# crashdetector

"crashDetector" is an iOS app written in Swift (updated to Swift 2.0) with 
the intention of graphing accelerometer data provided by the
CoreMotion framework's CMMotionManager.
The app maintains the last 10 seconds of motion to keep
track of the maximum force on each vector.

The technique for graphing the data uses this tutorial from Ray Wenderlich's 
"Core Graphics Tutorial Part 2: Gradients and Contexts":
